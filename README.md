# About Me
## Guessing game/questions

### *Lab 2:*
I created a page about me for others to visit. The goal of this project was to create a page that has my Bio, education, experience and goals. I also created a prompt for visitors to interact, where they provide their name and play a guessing game on how well they know me. The answers the user provides is logged in the console and I created a costume greeting that welcomes the user by name. After they play the guessing game, the page provides them with their correct guess score for all 5 questions. It then gives them a final welcome message and gives them access to the page.
